# React Client for AI Bot

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in watch mode. See the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. It optimizes the app for the best performance and makes it ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is irreversible. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back.**

This command removes the single build dependency and gives you full control over the build configuration. Only use it if you need to customize the build setup.

## Backend Code

The backend for this project is built using Django and can be found in the [Ai_bot_Server_django repository](https://github.com/Abhishek3223/Ai_bot_Server_django). Make sure to set up the backend server for handling requests from this React client.
